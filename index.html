							<h1>Fall Work Term Report <h3> ~ <I>Jiya Jayswal</I> </h3></h1>
							

						</p>
						<p> From September 2025 to December 2025, I completed a Digital Transformation Co-op at DLL - De Lage Landen Financial Services Canada Inc. in Burlington, Ontario, a global asset finance company specializing in equipment leasing and structured financing solutions. In this role, I worked with the Digital Transformation team on Odessa, DLL’s enterprise web platform for managing leases, contracts, and customer profiles, and on automated reporting tools used by management across Canada. This report describes my technical contributions, the systems I worked with, and how the experience shaped my skills as a computer science student. </p>

						<h2>Employer and Team</h2>
						<p>
						  DLL operates in the financial services sector, with a strong focus on asset-based financing and long-term leasing arrangements. The Canadian office supports a large user base of internal stakeholders who rely on various digital systems to originate, approve, and service leases. Within this environment, the Digital Transformation team is responsible for improving the usability, reliability, and efficiency of internal tools, particularly Odessa, which serves as the core system of record for contract and customer data. Odessa is a browser-based enterprise application that integrates data from multiple back-end systems and exposes it through configurable dashboards, search interfaces, and detailed summary pages for customers, contracts, and invoices. My work term focused on improving how users interact with these interfaces, enhancing documentation so that processes are consistent, and building complementary reporting tools in Excel to visualize operational performance.

						<h2>Work Term Goals</h2>
						<p>
							My learning goals for this work term were Technological Literacy, Problem Solving, Written Communication, Teamwork, and Time Management. These goals were tied to job tasks such as Odessa documentation, Genesys CRM testing, SLA reporting automation, Power Automate flows, and Odessa UX design, all of which I fully achieved.
							<br>
							<br>
							I aimed to gain hands-on experience with enterprise tools like Excel, SharePoint, and Power Automate to improve efficiency and support data-driven decision-making. For example, I built automated Excel dashboards using complex formulas, pivot tables, and scripting, reducing manual reporting by ~70%, and maintained SharePoint hubs for over 1,000 users. I also developed Power Automate workflows, refined web interfaces, and created documentation to support users.
							<br><br>
							Reflecting on my goals, I successfully enhanced technical skills, applied problem-solving to real workflows, strengthened teamwork and communication, and improved time management by meeting project deadlines. All objectives were completed, and no goals were left unachieved. This experience equipped me with practical skills in automation, UX, software testing, and cross-functional collaboration that will directly benefit my next co-op term.

						<h2>Job Description</h2>
						<p>
							As a Digital Transformation Co-op at DLL, I enhanced Odessa, the core platform for lease and contract management, and related tools used by North American asset finance teams. My responsibilities included UX refinement, documentation, automation, functional testing, and cross-team support, providing exposure to enterprise-scale systems and real-world workflows.
<br>
<br>
Key contributions included redesigning dashboards, the Activity Center, and Customer/Contract pages to improve usability, creating Odessa Hub Learning Bytes documenting login processes, dashboard personalization, and page navigation, and building Excel dashboards with advanced formulas, pivot tables, and scripting to track agent productivity, reducing manual reporting by ~70%. I also automated SLA reports using Power Automate workflows triggered by SharePoint List changes and large Genesys CRM datasets, and conducted end-to-end functional testing, logging bugs and supporting issue resolution.
<br>
<br>
This role required skills in UX design, Excel scripting, Power Automate, software testing, and technical documentation. While I had foundational knowledge from coursework in data structures and testing methodologies, I strengthened these skills on the job through hands-on experience, working with large datasets, iterative feedback, and collaboration with stakeholders. This enhanced my technical writing, user-centered design, data analysis, and cross-functional teamwork skills, all essential for enterprise delivery.

It highlights hands-on work with enterprise tools such as Excel, SharePoint, Power Automate, and Genesys CRM, along with collaboration across teams to improve efficiency, data reliability, and user experience. Overall, the term reflects practical problem-solving, technical growth, and meaningful contributions to enterprise systems that support asset finance operations.
